# Issue Tracker [Server/Daemon]
This is a sample issue tracker application that communicates through RabbitMQ
The app is written in C# and uses MongoDB as the storage

## Naming

### RabbitMQ 

RabbitMQ names should match the following template: [rabbitmq-entity].[domain-entity].[application].[unique-name]
They mush contain 4 blocks of data separated with **'.'**

#### RabbitMQ Entities
- Queue names should start with **q.**
- Exchange names should start with **e.**
- Routing keys should start with **r.**

#### Domain entities
- RabbitMQ entities that have something to do with __issues__ should have __.i.__ in their name
- RabbitMQ entities that have something to do with __statuses__ should have __.s.__ in their name
- RabbitMQ entities that have something to do with __users__ should have __.u.__ in their name

#### Application
Should contain name of the application that owns the RabbitMQ entity (queue or exchange)

#### Unique Name
This is block is not particularly defined. There could be anything that helps you understand what is this queue/exchange for
for instance `e.i.it-daemon.command` and `e.i.it-daemon.query`

## Routing
Considering former naming rules, we can come up with some routing rules for RabbitMQ

## Methods
To remotely call a daemon procedure client needs to send a message with `reply-to` and `correlation-id` to `e.all.all.forward` with appropriate routing key (depends on what entity you want to alter or query) and JSON body in format

```json
{
  "method": ${methodName},
  "data": ${objectFields}
}
```

Where `${methodName}` must be replaced with `get`, `create`, `update` or `delete`

And `${objectFields}` must be replaced with the fields which daemon will need for procedure executing 

**For example**

1. If you need to create a user

  ##### Header:
    * Reply To: q.u.client.reply
    * Correlation Id: 1488
  
  ##### Body:
  ```json
  {
    "method": "create",
    "data": {
      "username": "jo123",
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "password": "j0j1be@7s",
      "role": "Admin"
    }
  }
  ```
  *Note: we do not explicitly set the __id__ - daemon will take care of it himself*

2. If you later need to alter this user, for example, change it's password

  ##### Header:
    * Reply To: q.u.client.reply
    * Correlation Id: 8814
    
  ##### Body:
  ```json
  {
    "method": "update",
    "data": {
      "id": 12,
      "password": "0reW@0ch1nch1nG@D@1suk1N@nd@y0"
    }
  }
  ```
  *Note: The user id can be gathered from `e.u.daemon.feed` or throught `get` request*
